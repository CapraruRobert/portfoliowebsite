A&E Films — Portfolio

This is a lightweight static portfolio site for A&E Films (photography & videography).

Files included:
- `eduard-inspired.html` — main site
- `thumbnails/` — image thumbnails
- `videography-portfolio.html` — older copy

Notes:
- Video files are intentionally excluded from the repo via `.gitignore` (they are large).

Quick deploy options

1) GitHub Pages (free)
- Go to: https://github.com/CapraruRobert/portfoliowebsite/settings/pages
- Under "Build and deployment", choose branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)` then Save.
- The site will be published at `https://CapraruRobert.github.io/portfoliowebsite/` after a minute.

2) Netlify (recommended for custom domain and faster deploys)
- Sign up at https://app.netlify.com and connect your GitHub account.
- Add a new site -> Import from Git -> select `CapraruRobert/portfoliowebsite` -> Deploy.
- Optionally add a custom domain and Netlify will provide SSL automatically.

Custom domain (Namecheap / Google Domains etc.)
- For GitHub Pages: add a `CNAME` record pointing to `CapraruRobert.github.io` (set in repo Pages settings and in your domain provider DNS).
- For Netlify: add your domain in Netlify and follow their DNS instructions (usually an ALIAS/ANAME or CNAME).

If you want, I can enable GitHub Pages for you (I can guide you through the Settings page) or connect this repo to Netlify step-by-step.
